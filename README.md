## Plexdata Template Formatter

The _Plexdata Template Formatter_ represents an alternative to `String.Format()`, but with template support.

Main feature of this library is that template formatting is possible beside standard formatting, as it is done by `String.Format()`.

As extension to `String.Format()`, _stringification_ as well as _serialization_ operations of indexâ€“based format arguments are supported as well.

More information about template formatting can be found on the Internet under [https://messagetemplates.org](https://messagetemplates.org).

### Examples

Here are some examples of how to use this template formatter.

Below find a typical string format using the standard .NET Framework function `String.Format()`.

```
String.Format("Invoice for customer {0} for the sum of {1:C2}.", "John Doe", 123.45)
```

Now, the same as above but with this template formatter using standard format instructions as well as template format instructions.

```
Template.Format("Invoice for customer {0} for the sum of {1:C2}.", "John Doe", 123.45)
Template.Format("Invoice for customer {customer} for the sum of {totalsum:C2}.", "John Doe", 123.45)
```

But there are many more features available. Therefore, please read the documentation, that can be found [here](https://akesseler.github.io/Plexdata.Utilities.Templates/).
