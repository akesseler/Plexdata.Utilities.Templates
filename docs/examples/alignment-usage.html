<p>
    This section provides some alignment examples. <em>Alignment</em> means in this case that
    additional value alignment instructions are used as well. The alignment itself is separated
    by comma and is followed by the total character width. A negative value means &ldquo;left
    justified&rdquo; and a positive value means &ldquo;right justified&rdquo;. But not a plus
    sign <samp>'+'</samp> for a positive value is not allowed.

<h3 id="examples-alignment-usage-index-based">Index&ndash;based Formatting</h3>

<p>
    This example shows an index&ndash;based formatting with system types as well as with value
    alignment.
</p>

<div class="copy-code-snippet-text"><a href="#" onclick="copyToClipboard('alignment-index-based-example-1');return false;">Copy</a></div>
<pre id="alignment-index-based-example-1"><code>Template.Format("left [{1,-20}] right [{0,20}]", 111111, 222222);</code></pre>

<p>
    The result would look like <samp>"left [222222              ] right [              111111]"</samp>.

<div class="copy-code-snippet-text"><a href="#" onclick="copyToClipboard('alignment-index-based-example-2');return false;">Copy</a></div>
<pre id="alignment-index-based-example-2"><code>Template.Format("left [{1,-20:N2}] right [{0,20:C3}]", 111111, 222222);</code></pre>

<p>
    The result would look like <samp>"left [222,222.00          ] right [        $111,111.000]"</samp>.
</p>

<h3 id="examples-alignment-usage-label-based">Label&ndash;based Formatting</h3>

<p>
    This example shows a label&ndash;based formatting with system types as well as with value
    alignment.
</p>

<div class="copy-code-snippet-text"><a href="#" onclick="copyToClipboard('alignment-label-based-example-1');return false;">Copy</a></div>
<pre id="alignment-label-based-example-1"><code>Template.Format("left [{ValA,-20}] right [{ValB,20}]", 111111, 222222);</code></pre>

<p>
    The result would look like <samp>"left [111111              ] right [              222222]"</samp>.
    This is pretty much the same result as for its index&ndash;based counterpart except that the
    argument order is different.
