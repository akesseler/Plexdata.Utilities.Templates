<p>
    By design, the <em>Plexdata Template Formatter</em> does not handle exceptions internally,
    except for value formatting. Hence, the implementation checks and validates each of its
    input parameters so that an unexpected exception becomes unlikely to occur. But there is
    no guarantee that exceptions will never be thrown.
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes value formatting may fail and usually ends up in an exception. As mentioned above,
    the template formatter is designed to suppress exceptions as often as possible. But exceptions
    that occur during value formatting are caught and will be put into the output, instead of
    re&ndash;throwing them. Here an example.
</p>

<p>
    The code snippet below uses a wrong date format which in turn causes a format exception.
</p>

<div class="copy-code-snippet-text"><a href="#" onclick="copyToClipboard('exception-handling-example-1');return false;">Copy</a></div>
<pre id="exception-handling-example-1"><code>Decimal price = 123456.789M;
DateTime date = DateTime.Parse("2020-10-29T23:05:17.123");

Template.Format("Price: {price:C2} Date {date:K}", price, date);</code></pre>

<p>
    Instead of re&ndash;throwing the format exception, the result would look like
    <samp>"Price: $123,456.79 Date [{date:K} => FormatException: "Input string was not in a correct format."]"</samp>.
</p>

<p>
    Keep in mind, this behaviour also includes exceptions that might be thrown in any implementation
    of interface <samp>IArgumentSerializer</samp>.
