<p>
    This section provides some extended examples. <em>Extended</em> means in this case that
    additional value format instructions are used as well.
</p>

<h3 id="examples-extended-formatting-index-based">Index&ndash;based Formatting</h3>

<p>
    This example shows an index&ndash;based formatting with system types as well as with format
    instructions.
</p>

<div class="copy-code-snippet-text"><a href="#" onclick="copyToClipboard('extended-index-based-example-1');return false;">Copy</a></div>
<pre id="extended-index-based-example-1"><code>Template.Format("text {1:N2} text {0:C} text {2}", 1111111.1111, 2222.2222, 333.33);</code></pre>

<p>
    The result would look like <samp>"text 2,222.22 text $1,111,111.11 text 333.33"</samp>. This
    should be expected because of its the same result as for <samp>String.Format()</samp>.
</p>

<p>
    This example shows an index&ndash;based formatting with system types and format instructions
    as well as with stringification. In other words, the operator <samp>'$'</samp> is used together
    with argument indices.
</p>

<div class="copy-code-snippet-text"><a href="#" onclick="copyToClipboard('extended-index-based-example-2');return false;">Copy</a></div>
<pre id="extended-index-based-example-2"><code>Template.Format("text {$1:N2} text {$0:C} text {$2}", 1111111.1111, 2222.2222, 333.33);</code></pre>

<p>
    The result would look like <samp>"text 2222.2222 text 1111111.1111 text 333.33"</samp>. The
    reason is method <samp>ToString()</samp> of each argument is called instead of performing
    argument formatting.
</p>

<p>
    This example shows an index&ndash;based formatting with system types and format instructions as well as with serialization.
    In other words, the operator <samp>'@'</samp> is used together with argument indices.
</p>

<div class="copy-code-snippet-text"><a href="#" onclick="copyToClipboard('extended-index-based-example-3');return false;">Copy</a></div>
<pre id="extended-index-based-example-3"><code>Template.Format("text {@1:N2} text {@0:C} text {@2}", 1111111.1111, 2222.2222, 333.33);</code></pre>

<p>
    The result would look like <samp>"text 2,222.22 text $1,111,111.11 text 333.33"</samp>. Ends
    up with the same result as for standard formatting.
</p>

<h3 id="examples-extended-formatting-label-based">Label&ndash;based Formatting</h3>

<p>
    This example shows a label&ndash;based formatting with system types as well as with format
    instructions.
</p>

<div class="copy-code-snippet-text"><a href="#" onclick="copyToClipboard('extended-label-based-example-1');return false;">Copy</a></div>
<pre id="extended-label-based-example-1"><code>Template.Format("text {ValA:N2} text {ValB:C} text {ValC}", 1111111.1111, 2222.2222, 333.33);</code></pre>

<p>
    The result would look like <samp>"text 1,111,111.11 text $2,222.22 text 333.33"</samp>. This
    should be expected because of its the same result as for <samp>String.Format()</samp>.
</p>

<p>
    This example shows a label&ndash;based formatting with system types and format instructions
    as well as with stringification. In other words, the operator <samp>'$'</samp> is used together
    with template labels.
</p>

<div class="copy-code-snippet-text"><a href="#" onclick="copyToClipboard('extended-label-based-example-2');return false;">Copy</a></div>
<pre id="extended-label-based-example-2"><code>Template.Format("text {$ValA:N2} text {$ValB:C} text {$ValC}", 1111111.1111, 2222.2222, 333.33);</code></pre>

<p>
    The result would look like <samp>"text 1111111.1111 text 2222.2222 text 333.33"</samp>. The
