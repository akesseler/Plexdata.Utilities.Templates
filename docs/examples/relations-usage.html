<p>
    Relations as well as obtaining them is a very special feature. Usually, this functionality not
    of interest of standard template formatting. This is because of it has been designed especially
    to be used together with logging libraries. Most of these logging libraries provide a parameter for
    additional logging information that almost always consist of a list of label&ndash;value&ndash;pairs.
    And this is exactly what this feature wants to support.
</p>

<p>
    In detail, <em>Relations</em> means the relation between arguments and their occurrence inside the
    format string. And as already mentioned, this feature is reserved for a very specific use case,
    formatting of logging messages. But anyway, users may take advantage of this feature for any other
    purpose. Furthermore, this feature works for index&ndash;based as well as for label&ndash;based
    formatting instructions. But keep in mind, the name <samp>"Value"</samp> is prepended in case of
    index&ndash;based formatting instructions.
</p>

<p>
    The example below shows how to obtain argument relations as well as how to process them.
</p>

<div class="copy-code-snippet-text"><a href="#" onclick="copyToClipboard('relations-usage-example-1');return false;">Copy</a></div>
<pre id="relations-usage-example-1"><code>IArgumentRelations relations;
String result = Template.Format(out relations, "text {1} text {0} text {2} text {1}", 111, "John Doe", 333.33);

Console.WriteLine(result);
foreach ((String Label, Object Value) relation in relations.ToArray())
{
    Console.WriteLine($"* {relation.Label}: {relation.Value}");
}</code></pre>

<p>
    The result printed out to the <em>Console</em> window would look like as shown here.
</p>

<pre style="background-color: black; color: lightgray;"><code>text John Doe text 111 text 333.33 text John Doe
* Value1: John Doe
* Value0: 111
* Value2: 333.33</code></pre>


<p>
    As already stated, each label is prepended by name <samp>"Value"</samp> and is followed by
    the index of its occurrence within the format string. But this applies to index&ndash;based
    formatting only. Furthermore, redundant label&ndash;value&ndash;pairs are avoided.
</p>

<p>
    Something similar is also possible with template parameters. But in such a case the template 
    parameter label is used instead, as the next example demonstrates.
</p>

<div class="copy-code-snippet-text"><a href="#" onclick="copyToClipboard('relations-usage-example-3');return false;">Copy</a></div>
<pre id="relations-usage-example-3"><code>IArgumentRelations relations;
String result = Template.Format(out relations, "text {index} text {user} text {price}", 111, "John Doe", 333.33);

Console.WriteLine(result);
foreach ((String Label, Object Value) relation in relations.ToArray())
{
    Console.WriteLine($"* {relation.Label}: {relation.Value}");
}</code></pre>

<p>
    In this case the result printed out to the <em>Console</em> window would look like as shown here.
</p>

<pre style="background-color: black; color: lightgray;"><code>text 111 text John Doe text 333.33
* index: 111
* user: John Doe
* price: 333.33</code></pre>
