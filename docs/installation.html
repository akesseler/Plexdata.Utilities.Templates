        Open menu <em>Tools &rarr; NuGet Package Manager</em> and choose command <em>Manage NuGet Packages for Solution&hellip;</em>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Alternatively, right&#8209;click the project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> and choose command <em>Manage NuGet Packages&hellip;</em>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        projects you want to assign the chosen package.

        Finally, click button <samp>[Install]</samp> at the right and confirm the dialog box. That&rsquo;s it. All dependent libraries are installed automatically.
