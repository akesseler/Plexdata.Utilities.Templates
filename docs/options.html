<p>
    The <em>Plexdata Template Formatter</em> provides some settings to allow a minimum setup
    of template formatting. This section wants to give a short overview about these options
    and their meaning.
</p>

<p>
    Class <samp>Options</samp> in namespace <samp>Plexdata.Utilities.Formatting</samp> can be 
    used to configure the formatting behaviour. An instance of this class is then used together 
    with a call of one of the overloads of <samp>Template.Format()</samp>. How to do this is 
    shown in this very short and abstract code snippet.
</p>


<div class="copy-code-snippet-text"><a href="#" onclick="copyToClipboard('options-example-1');return false;">Copy</a></div>
<pre id="options-example-1"><code>Options options = new Options()
{
    // ...
};

Template.Format(options, ...);</code></pre>

<h3>Provider</h3>

<p>
    Property <samp>Provider</samp> is used to perform value formatting according to additional format
    instructions. It can be changed by users into any class derived from <samp>IFormatProvider</samp>.
    No provider&ndash;specific formatting is performed if this property is set to <samp>null</samp>.
    Its default value is set to <samp>CultureInfo.InvariantCulture</samp>.
</p>

<h3>Serializer</h3>

<p>
    Property <samp>Serializer</samp> allows users to apply a custom&ndash;specific serializer for
    complex data types. Its default value is set to <samp>null</samp>.
</p>
<p>
    Such a custom class must be derived from interface <samp>IArgumentSerializer</samp> in namespace
    <samp>Plexdata.Utilities.Formatting.Interfaces</samp>. As well, such a class must be able to
    serialize every custom&ndash;specific data type. Furthermore, this serializer
    is not used for build&ndash;in system types. An internal fallback serializer is used if no other
    argument serializer has been applied.
</p>

<h3>Maximum</h3>

<p>
    Property <samp>Maximum</samp> allows users to apply a limitation of the maximum result length. Its
    default value is set to <samp>Int32.MaxValue</samp>. Please keep in mind, any value less than one
    or greater than <samp>Int32.MaxValue-1</samp> is treated as &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo;. More
    information about using this property can be found in the examples.
</p>

<h3>IsLimited</h3>

<p>
    Property <samp>IsLimited</samp> is nothing else but a convenient getter to determine whether result
    length limitation is applied or not. It returns <samp>true</samp> if the <samp>Maximum</samp> is set to a range of <samp>1</samp>
    up to <samp>Int32.MaxValue-1</samp>. Otherwise <samp>false</samp> is returned.
</p>

<h3>Fallback</h3>

<p>
    Property <samp>Fallback</samp> allows to define a custom&ndash;specific name to be used as alternative
    label for unresolved arguments. Its default value is set to <samp>null</samp>. This causes the formatter
    to show the whole formatting string for each argument that could not be resolved. Otherwise the value
    of this property is shown. More information about using this property can be found in the examples.
</p>

<h3>IsFallback</h3>

<p>
    Property <samp>IsFallback</samp> is nothing else but a convenient getter to determine whether the value
    of property <samp>Fallback</samp> should be used or not. It returns <samp>false</samp> if the value of
    property <samp>Fallback</samp> is <samp>null</samp>. Otherwise <samp>true</samp> is returned.
</p>

<h3>Default</h3>

<p>
    Class <samp>Options</samp> provides a public field named <samp>Default</samp> to obtain the standard
    settings. The value of this field is used if no other settings are provided and uses all of the default
    values as shown above.
